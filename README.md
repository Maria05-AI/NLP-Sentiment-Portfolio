# NLP - Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Portfolio

> **"Theory provides the map, but practice creates the path."**

## Project Story & Motivation
During my preparatory year in Computer Science, I was fascinated by Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. However, I wanted to go beyond the theory and academic datasets.
Also after we get a little bit deep in our major "AI" my journey with this project began, during a university course on **Python and Data Analysis**. We were introduced to the basics of sentiment analysis through a standard class project using a ready-made dataset.

While that academic project laid the foundation, I felt a strong urge to go beyond the basics. I wanted to move away from the "black box" of pre-packaged datasets and experiment with building something from scratch. I found the idea of testing different scenarios—manually crafting a dataset versus handling massive real-world data—to be incredibly exciting and intellectually stimulating.

Therefore, I decided to build this portfolio as an independent deep-dive experiment. It represents my transition from simply applying what I learned in class to actively questioning, testing, and mastering the nuances of Natural Language Processing.

I created this repository as a **comparative experiment** driven by curiosity. My goal was to explore the gap between:
1.  **Small-Scale / Manual Data:** Building a dataset from scratch for a morphologically rich language (Arabic).
2.  **Large-Scale / Real-World Data:** Using massive standard datasets (IMDB) for a global language (English).

This portfolio documents my journey, the challenges I faced with Arabic NLP (like negation and limited vocabulary), and the robustness achieved with English Big Data.
